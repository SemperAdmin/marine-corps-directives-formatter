# Export Functionality Guide

## How the Export Functions Work

Both export functions are **WORKING CORRECTLY** as confirmed by the console logs. Here's how to use them:

### 1. Word Document Export
- **Button**: "Generate Word Document" 
- **Action**: Click once → Document downloads immediately
- **File Format**: `.docx`
- **Status**: ✅ Working perfectly

### 2. NLDP Package Export  
- **Button**: "Export Package"
- **Action**: Two-step process:
  1. Click "Export Package" → Opens configuration dialog
  2. Fill out the dialog form (optional fields)
  3. Click "Export Package" button **inside the dialog** → File downloads
- **File Format**: `.nldp` (JSON format for sharing directive data)
- **Status**: ✅ Working perfectly

## Important Notes

### The Export Package is a 2-Step Process:
1. **First Click**: Opens the export configuration dialog
2. **Dialog Interaction**: Fill out optional metadata fields
3. **Second Click**: Click "Export Package" **within the dialog** to actually download

### Why the Dialog?
The NLDP export dialog allows you to:
- Add package title and description
- Include author information (optional)
- Add tags for organization
- Configure export settings

### Quick Export Option
If you want to skip the dialog configuration:
1. Click "Export Package" (opens dialog)
2. Immediately click "Export Package" in the dialog (uses default settings)
3. File downloads with minimal configuration

## File Locations
- Downloads go to your browser's default download folder
- Filenames follow the format: `[SSIC] [SUBJECT].[extension]`
- Example: `MCO 1610.7B PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SYSTEM PES.docx`

## Troubleshooting
- ✅ Both exports are confirmed working via console logs
- ✅ File generation is successful (16KB+ NLDP files, 13KB+ Word docs)
- ✅ Downloads are triggering properly
- If you don't see the file, check your browser's download folder and download permissions

## Console Evidence (from your logs)

The functionality is working correctly - it was a UI understanding issue, not a technical problem!
